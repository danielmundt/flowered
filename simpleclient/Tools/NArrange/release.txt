*** IMPORTANT ***
In version 0.2.7 the default configuration was changed to match the ordering rules enforced by Microsoft's C# source analysis tool StyleCop.  For those wishing to use the old default configuration, a copy has been provided in DefaultConfig.v026.xml.  Please retain a copy of this file for your usage as it may not be distributed in future releases.


The following changes were made in this release:

0.2.7.0
- By default, provide a StyleCop compatible configuration for ordering of members.
- Allow consecutive blank lines to be removed within member bodies.
- Allow disabling of directives for individual regions.
